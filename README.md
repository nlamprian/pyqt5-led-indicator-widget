# pyqt5-led-indicator-widget

This is a simple LED indicator for PyQt5. It is derived from [QLedIndicator](https://www.linux-apps.com/content/show.php/QLedIndicator?content=118610) and updated to work with Python and Qt5.

# Usage

There is a demo app `DemoApp.py` presenting an example usage and allowing to test an LED.

Each of the two states (on and off) of an LED is accompanied by two colors. These are the two base colors of a gradient. Initialize them as necessary to set your desired on/off colors. There are available definitions for green and red.
